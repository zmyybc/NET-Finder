Installation
============

This guide will walk you through the process of installing NET-Finder and its dependencies.

System Requirements
-------------------

Before installing NET-Finder, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Python: version 3.8 or higher
- Git: for cloning the repository

Dependencies
------------

NET-Finder requires the following Python packages:

- ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)
- matplotlib
- scipy
- numpy

These will be installed automatically during the NET-Finder installation process.

Installation Steps
------------------

1. Clone the NET-Finder repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/your-repo/NET-Finder.git
      cd NET-Finder

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -m venv net-finder-env
      source net-finder-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `net-finder-env\Scripts\activate`

3. Install NET-Finder and its dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -e .

   This command installs NET-Finder in editable mode, allowing you to modify the source code if needed.

4. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python -c "import net_finder; print(net_finder.__version__)"

   This should print the version number of NET-Finder.

5. Add NET-Finder to your Python path:

   .. code-block:: bash

      export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/NET-Finder:$PYTHONPATH

   You may want to add this line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`) to make it permanent.

Installing Optional Dependencies
--------------------------------

Depending on your specific use case, you might need to install additional packages:

- For VASP calculations:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install ase-vasp

- For visualization:

  .. code-block:: bash

     pip install ase-gui

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter any issues during installation, please check the following:

1. Ensure that you have the latest version of pip:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install --upgrade pip

2. If you're having issues with a specific dependency, try installing it separately:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install ase matplotlib scipy numpy

3. Check that your system's Python version meets the requirements:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python --version

If you continue to experience problems, please open an issue on the NET-Finder GitHub repository with details about the error and your system configuration.
